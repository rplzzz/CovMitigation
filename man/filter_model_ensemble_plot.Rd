\title{Plot traces for ensemble members in a filter model fit}
\usage{
filter_model_ensemble_plot(
  filterfit,
  what = "fi",
  Nplot = 50,
  highlight = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filterfit}{Filter-fit object}

\item{what}{Variable to plot (fi, beta, ncase, import_cases).  Default is \code{fi}.
If ncase is selected, then the observed effective case counts will be plotted as points.}

\item{Nplot}{Number of ensemble members (randomly selected) to plot.  Default
is to plot 50.  If \code{NULL}, then plot all.}

\item{highlight}{List of ensemble member ids to overplot in a highlight
